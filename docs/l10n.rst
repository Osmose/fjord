==================
 Maintaining l10n
==================


Things to know about l10n
=========================

1. translations are done in Pontoon

2. translators are looking at our -dev environment to see the strings
   in use

3. the -dev environment should have a cronjob kicking off every 10
   minutes that updates the git locale repository so that translators
   can see the latest stuff

Installing localizations from git
=================================

Localizations are not stored in this repository--they're in Mozilla's
Git repository.

To get the localizations, do::

    git clone https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/input-l10n.git locale

To see the translated strings, you need to first compile the .po files to
.mo files::

    ./bin/compile-mo.sh locale/

Then you need to comment out the ``DEV_LANGUAGES`` option from your local
settings file, ``./fjord/settings/local.py``.

.. _l10n-update-strings:

Extract/merge/sync strings with git
===================================

First, update the git repository::

    cd locale
    git pull origin master
    cd ..

Then, extract the strings from the codebase::

    ./manage.py extract_db
    ./manage.py extract
    ./manage.py merge

Commit the db strings to the app repo::

    git commit -a

Then, commit the new strings to the string repo::

    cd locale
    git commit -m 'Input strings update YYYY/MM/DD'

.. Note::

   There are also instructions in ``./locale/README.txt``.

After that, send an email to the `dev-l10n-web mailing list
<https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n-web>`_ using this template::

    Hi!

    I've just pushed new strings to Pontoon for Input.

    https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/firefox-input/

    < explanation of strings changes here >

    To give you an idea of how many untranslated strings there are, I
    have computed this list:

    < copy and paste output of "./bin/stats-po.sh locale/" >

    If you have any questions, please reply to the list.

    Thank you so much for your help!

    Input development team


Sometimes we have to create bugs for each individual locale to update the
translations. It's nice to copy/paste the specific strings that need to be
translated.

Sometimes the translator says they've finished, but the string updates aren't
in git. If that happens, contact the Pontoon admin team.


Creating new localization locales
=================================

FIXME: This section is probably wrong.

In your projects ``settings.py`` add the new locale to
``KNOWN_LANGUAGES``.

Then run::

    $ ./manage.py merge -c

which will create directories for any locales that are missing in
``locale/``.
