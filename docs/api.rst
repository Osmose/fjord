The Feedback API is for getting/posting product feedback data.


Getting product feedback: GET /api/v1/feedback/
===============================================

:URL:            ``/api/v1/feedback/``
:Method:         HTTP GET
:Payload format: No payload--everything is done in the querystring
:Response:       JSON

Doing a GET without any querystring arguments will return the most
recent 1,000 publicly visible responses for all products.

.. Warning::

   This API endpoint is throttled. If you hit it too often, you'll get
   throttled. You just need to wait a bit for the throttle to expire.


.. Note::

   This API endpoint is still in flux. The documentation is
   rudimentary at best. Amongst other things, it's difficult to
   discover valid values for things.

   If you're using this API endpoint and have issues, please
   `open a bug
   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Input&rep_platform=all&op_sys=all&component=General>`_.

Testing clients using the API
-----------------------------

.. Warning::

   **DO NOT TEST YOUR CLIENT AGAINST OUR PRODUCTION SERVER. IT WILL
   MAKE CHENG, MATT, TYLER AND I CROSS.**


Seriously. Please don't test your client against our production
server.

Test your client against our stage server which runs the same code
that our production server does. The url for the our stage server is::

    https://input.allizom.org/
                  ^^^^^^^


Please make sure to use the correct domain!

    .. Note::

       The form this field is on should have some informational text
       stating that data in this field will be publicly available and

       information.

       Input admin to have your product added.

**email**
    String. The email address of the user. This allows us to
    contact the user at some later point to respond to the user's
    feedback or ask for more information.

    Example: ``"joe@example.com"``

    .. Note::

       The form this field is in should state that email addresses
       will not be publicly available.

       Example informational text::

           While your feedback will be publicly visible, email addresses
           are kept private. We understand your privacy is important.

**user_agent**
    String. Max length: 255. The user agent of the client if
    applicable. For example if the user is using a Firefox OS device,
    this would be the user agent of the browser used to send feedback.

    Example: ``'Mozilla/5.0 (Mobile; rv:18.0) Gecko/18.0 Firefox/18.0'``

**source**
    String. Max length: 100. If this response was initiated by a blog
    post, wiki page, search, newsletter, tweet or something like that,
    this is the source that initiated the response. It has the same
    semantics as the utm_source querystring parameter:

    https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867

    Example: ``'Hacks blog'``

    .. Note::

       Don't set the source if the user is leaving feedback of their
       own accord. Only set the source if you have prompted or asked
       the user to leave feedback.

**campaign**
    String. Max length: 100. If this response was initiated by a
    marketing campaign, this is the name of the campaign. It has the
    same semantics as the utm_campaign querystring parameter:

    https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867

    Example: ``'show the firefox love post'``

    .. Note::

       Don't set the campaign if the user is leaving feedback of their
       own accord. Only set the campaign if you have prompted or asked
       the user to leave feedback.


Extra context
-------------

You can provide additional context in the form of key/value pairs by
adding additional data to the JSON object.

Any fields that aren't part of the required or optional fields list
will get thrown into a JSON object and dumped in the feedback response
context.

For example, if the product were the Firefox devtools and you want
feedback responses to include the theme (dark or light) that the user
was using, you could add this to the JSON object::

    {
        "happy": true,
        "description": "devtools are the best!",
        "product": "Devtools",
        "theme": "dark"
    }


That last key will get added to the feedback response context.

.. Note::

   Obviously, don't use a key that's already the name of a
   field. Also, since this is not future proof, you might want to
   prepend a unique string to any keys you add.


.. Note::

   It's important you don't add ids or data that allows you to
   correlate feedback responses to things in other data sets. That
   violates our privacy policy.


Minimal example with curl
-------------------------

::

    $ curl -v -XPOST 'https://input.allizom.org/api/v1/feedback' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' \
        -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        -d '
    {
        "happy": true,
        "description": "Posting by api!",
        "product": "Firefox"
    }'


Responses
---------

After posting feedback, you'll get one of several responses:


HTTP 201
    Feedback was posted successfully.

HTTP 400
    Feedback has errors. Details will be in the response body.

    Possibilities include:

    * missing required fields
    * email address is malformed
    * data is in the wrong format

HTTP 429
    There has been too many feedback postings from this IP address and
    the throttle trigger was hit. Try again later.
